# # Fast inference with vLLM (Mistral 7B)
#
# In this example, we show how to run basic inference, using [`vLLM`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
# to take advantage of PagedAttention, which speeds up sequential inferences with optimized key-value caching.
#
# `vLLM` also supports a use case as a FastAPI server, which we will explore in a future guide. This example
# walks through setting up an environment that works with `vLLM ` for basic inference.
#
# We are running the [Mistral 7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) model here,
# which is version of Mistral's 7B model that hase been fine-tuned to follow instructions.
# You can expect 20 second cold starts and well over 1000 tokens/second. The larger the batch of prompts, the higher the throughput.
# For example, with the 64 prompts below, we can produce 15k tokens in less than 7 seconds, a throughput of over 2k tokens/second.
#
# To run [any of the other supported models](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models.html),
# simply replace the model name in the download step.
#
# ## Setup
#
# First, we import the Modal client and define the model that we want to serve.

import os
import time

import modal

MODEL_DIR = "/model"
MODEL_NAME = "mistral-community/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3"
MODEL_REVISION = "df1c0be33bc77b5cef4c08c28721e37c01ba9b81"


# ## Define a container image
#
# We want to create a Modal image which has the model weights pre-saved to a directory. The benefit of this
# is that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Hugging Face - instead, it will take
# advantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.
#
# ### Download the weights
# We can download the model to a particular directory using the HuggingFace utility function `snapshot_download`.

# If you adapt this example to run another model,
# note that for this step to work on a [gated model](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated)
# the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable must be set and provided as a [Modal Secret](https://modal.com/secrets).

# We’ll start from Modal's baseline ``debian_slim` image.
# Then we’ll use `run_function` with `download_model_to_image` to write the model into the container image.

# ## The model class
#
# The inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions),
# using a `load_model` method decorated with `@modal.enter`. This enables us to load the model into memory just once,
# every time a container starts up, and to keep it cached on the GPU for subsequent invocations of the function.
#
# The `vLLM` library allows the code to remain quite clean.

# Hint: try out an H100 if you've got a large model or big batches!
